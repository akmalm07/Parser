##Guide Lin


### 1. Use Clear and Descriptive Names

-	Use meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes.

-	Avoid abbreviations unless they are well-known and widely accepted.

-	Use camel case (camalCase) for variable names, snake case (snake_case) for function names, and pascal case (PascalCode) or class/structure names.

-	For member variables, add underscore (_) and add the prefix lowercase G (g) and S (s) for global and static variables respectively (e.g., s_privateStaticMember).

-	For constants, use uppercase letters with underscores (e.g., MAX_SIZE).

-	For constant and/or reference definitions, add the key words (const&) after the type definition (e.g., std::vector<int> const& param1).

-	For list names, use plural nouns (e.g., items, users).
